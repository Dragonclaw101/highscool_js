//Javascript Functions

//Declare the function
//Name the function
//Define the function (What does it do?)
//Call it

function add(a, b){ //Passengers are called parameters

//One way: return a+b;

//Another way:

//var vs let - different (scoping). Let is the proper way to define a variable.
let sum = a + b;
return sum;

}

let a = 1;
let b = 5;

//console.log(a+b);
console.log(add(a,b)); //Don't have to use pre-defined variables, can add what you want in numbers.
console.log('Hello!');
